# IoT TraningKit - DataEgress
## Overview
Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that helps enable reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of devices and a solution back end.

Custom functionality which processes data or messages sent from devices to IoT Hub can retrieve information using two different patterns:
* Message Routing: IoT Hub actively ***pushes*** messages
* Service Endpoint: IoT Hub provides messages to be ***pulled***

## TL;DR
This repository showcases: 
- sending data to IoT Hub
- enriching the data with information from the device's Azure IoT Hub Device Twin
- routing all incoming messages to a custom endpoint (Azure Blob Storage)
- routing selected incoming messages based on a query to a custom endpoint (Azure Bob Storage)

## IoT Hub Functionality
### Message Routing (Push of messages)

IoT Hub allows the definition of message routes and and message endpoints. IoT Hub Message Routing enables users to route (push) device-to-cloud messages to service-facing endpoints. 

### Endpoints
The service-facing endpoint defines to which Azure service the message will be forwareded to. Currently messages can be routed to the following Azure services: 
- Storage containers (Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Gen 2)
- Event Hubs
- Service Bus Queues
- Service Bus Topics
- Cosmos DB (preview)

### Message Routes
A message route allows to define queries that are applied to each individual message processed by IoT Hub. These queries determine to which endpoint the message is routed. A route can be defined without a query and therefore all messages processed by IoT Hub will be pushed to a message endpoint defined in the route.

An IoT hub has a default built-in endpoint where messages arrive when: 
- there's no custom route defined
- a message doesn't macht any query

### Message enrichment
Message enrichments is the ability of an IoT hub to stamp messages with additional information before the messages are sent to the designated endpoint.
